# Video Assets

This directory is for storing video assets used in the Premier Planner website.

## Current Video Implementation

The main hero section currently uses a YouTube video embed (https://youtu.be/fntymTSXGIY) as the background.
This is implemented using the YouTube iFrame API for optimal performance and control.

If you want to switch to locally-hosted videos in the future, you can place them in this directory.

## Recommendations for Local Videos

If switching to local videos:

- **Hero Background Video**: 
  - Filename: `hero-background.mp4`
  - Recommended specs:
    - Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
    - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
    - Duration: 10-30 seconds
    - Size: Keep under 10MB for optimal performance
    - Content: Professional event footage with soft motion (e.g., elegant events, wedding receptions, corporate functions)

## Tips for Optimal Video Performance

1. **Compress your videos** to reduce file size while maintaining quality
2. Consider adding a WebM version for better browser compatibility
3. Use videos with subtle motion to avoid distracting from the content
4. Consider adding a slight blur or depth-of-field effect to keep focus on the text overlay
5. Choose videos with good contrast to ensure text readability
